<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a first-year master student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University, co-advised by [Junbo Zhao](http://jakezhao.net/) and [Haobo Wang](https://hbzju.github.io/). Previously, I recieved my B.E. degree in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University. I am currently devoted to the field of natural language processing and multimodal learning. My aspiration is to uncover the secrets of human cognition, and develop AI systems that learn and think more like humans. Outside of academia, I am a big fan of art, design, and all kinds of competitive sports. I am also a sneaker head! 😋

Big shout out to my parents for always supporting me and being the greatest mom and dad of all time. 🩵


# 🔥 What's New
- *2025.01*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 One paper accepted to **ICLR 2025**, which delves into table-text multimodal learning, one of the core parts of TableGPT2! Stay tuned for the upcoming camera-ready paper and source code! 
- *2024.12*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 I am joining the ByteDance Research AI-Lab as a research intern! Looking forward to building something cool on multimodal agents with the team! 🤩
- *2024.11*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 We release TableGPT2, an open-source table expert that excels in table-centric tasks while maintaining strong general language and coding abilities! Try out our brand new 7B model on [🤗HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/tablegpt/TableGPT2-7B)!
- *2024.05*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 One paper accpeted to **ACL 2024 Findings**! (Which also marks my personal milestone in the field of NLP! Let's keep going! 🤩) 
- *2024.02*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 My **FIRST** paper as the **FIRST** author, *Positive-Unlabeled Learning by Latent Group-Aware Meta Disambiguation*, was accepted by **CVPR 2024**! That's just the beginning!
- *2024.02*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 A paper that I have contributed to, *Property Existence Inference against Generative Models*, was accepted by **USENIX Security '24 Fall**.
